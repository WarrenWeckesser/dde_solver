dde_solver
==========

This repository contains my work on updating the DDE_SOLVER Fortran
code originally written by  S. Thompson and L. Shampine [1].

When the most recent version of the DDE_SOLVER code available from
S. Thompson is compiled with recent versions of gfortran, running the
solver may result in segmentation faults or other crashes.  The problem
appears to be that not enough interface declarations had been made in
the code, so gfortran did not know that some array arguments are
assumed-shape.  It passed invalid data in some subroutine calls,
resulting in a segmentation fault.

This repository started with the file "dde_solver_m.f90".  This file
was originally called "dde_solver_m_unix.f90" in the ZIP file available
on S. Thompson's web page.  The only difference between the original
"dde_solver_m.f90" and "dde_solver_m_unix.f90" was the line endings.
For this repository, I am maintaining just one file, with "Unix" (i.e.
practically every system except Windows) line endings.

Major changes to dde_solver_m.f90
---------------------------------
* Use assumed-shape arrays in all interfaces.  This fixed the segmentation
  faults that were occurring in the old version.  (User's old code will
  have to be updated to match the new interfaces.)
* Removed ODEAVG, and removed all the code in dde_solver_m.f90 related to
  averaging.  (This was done on the recommendation of S. Thompson.)
* Added the function DDE_SOLVER_VERSION that returns the software version.

This repository also has the examples that were part of the S. Thompson's
ZIP file download.  I am adding unit tests in the `tests` directory.
